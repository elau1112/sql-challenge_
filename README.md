# sql-challenge
# In the bonus session, "u_key" includes the 'Engine(postgresql://<username>:<password>@localhost:5432/sql_challenge)'. This is included in a separate 'dbkeys.py' file. According to the instruction, I should not upload my password to my GitHub repository. Thus, the 'dbkeys.py' file was not uploaded with the sql-challenge files here.

# Observations were included as comments in the Jupyter Notebook of the bonus analysis "SQL_Challenge_.ipynb".

# This submission included the following files as required: 
# 1) Two image files of my ERD
# 2) One sql file of my table schemata
# 3) One sql file of my queries
# 4) The Jupyter Notebook of the bonus analysis

# Thank you very much
